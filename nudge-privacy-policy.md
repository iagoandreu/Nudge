# Privacy Policy for Nudge Alarm

**Effective Date:** August 22, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Name or Company Name] ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in the Nudge Alarm application (the "App").

### 1. No Personal Data Collection

Nudge Alarm is designed with your privacy as a top priority. The App **does not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information.

We do not collect information such as your name, email address, location, contacts, or device identifiers.

### 2. Data You Create (Alarms and Statistics)

All data you create within the App, including your alarm settings (time, repeat days, sound choice, label) and your alarm statistics (elapsed time to stop an alarm), is stored **locally on your device**.

This data is sandboxed and is not accessible by us or any third party.

### 3. App Group Data Sharing

To provide widget functionality, the App uses a shared "App Group" container. This allows the main Nudge app and its widget extensions to share alarm and statistics data. This data remains on your device and is subject to the same privacy protections as all other local data. It is never transmitted off your device by the App.

### 4. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Since the App does not collect any personal information at all, it is safe for all ages.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
