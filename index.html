        <p>
            Let's be honest. The modern alarm clock is a masterpiece of flawed design. It solves a simple problem—making an unconscious person conscious—but completely ignores the far more difficult one: **making a conscious person functional.**
        </p>
        <p>
            The result? The snooze button. A feature that, by its very existence, institutionalizes failure before your feet have even touched the floor. You don't hit snooze because you need more sleep; you hit it because the decision to stop sleeping is too difficult to make in a groggy state. The cost of that decision is too high.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where we introduce a little bit of what you might call "choice architecture." Or, perhaps, a "beneficial impediment."
        </p>

        <h2>Most alarms wake your ears. Nudge wakes your brain.</h2>
        <p>
            Nudge doesn't just make a noise. It understands that the real battle for your morning is won or lost in the first 90 seconds of consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of presenting you with a simple "stop" button—a temptation for your still-dreaming mind to dismiss—Nudge gives you a simple, low-stakes puzzle. A sequence of patterns appears. To silence the alarm, you must watch, remember, and draw.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't a test of intelligence. It's not a stressful math problem. It is a pre-cognitive commitment. A small, achievable task that requires just enough focus to gently pull your brain from a state of inertia into a state of engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the time you've solved your patterns, something magical has happened. You haven't just silenced an alarm; you've completed a task. You've won. And that small victory creates the momentum you need to win the next one: getting out of bed.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is there no snooze button?</h2>
        <p>
            Because a snooze button is a feature that optimizes for failure. It is a vote of no-confidence in your future self. Nudge is different. It is a vote of confidence. It is designed to make the "right" decision—getting up—not just easier, but the only path forward. We didn't forget the snooze button; we eliminated the need for it.
